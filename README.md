# Website optimized for Firefox (use this to run)
# To start the project
Use tomcat as a server for the client side (if using IntelliJ as an editor; this is what I am currently using);
Use the live server plugin for the client side if using Visual Studio Code

# Using a Node.js Express to run the server side
Run 'npm install' to install all dependencies
Use 'npm start' to run the server
